# Temperature Analysis - NOAA Dataset

## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical temperature data from the NOAA dataset for the region near Ann Arbor, Michigan. The goal is to visualize record high and low temperatures from 2005-2014 and identify any record-breaking temperatures in 2015. Additionally, a map is generated to show the station locations.

## Dataset Description
The project uses two datasets:
- **temperature.csv**: Contains daily temperature records with station ID, date, temperature element (TMAX/TMIN), and temperature value (in tenths of degrees Celsius).
- **BinSize.csv**: Contains station location data with latitude and longitude.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the notebook:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib folium notebook
```

## Steps to Run the Notebook
1. **Load and Preprocess Data**
   - Read temperature data and convert date columns.
   - Remove leap days (Feb 29) for consistency.
   - Extract `DayOfYear` for yearly analysis.
   
2. **Compute Temperature Records**
   - Determine the highest and lowest temperatures for each day from 2005-2014.
   - Identify record-breaking temperatures in 2015.

3. **Visualize Data**
   - Plot record high and low temperatures with a shaded range.
   - Overlay scatter plots for 2015 record-breaking temperatures.

4. **Map Weather Stations**
   - Use `folium` to create an interactive map of station locations.

## Running the Notebook
- Open Jupyter Notebook:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```
- Run each cell in the notebook to process data, generate plots, and display results.

## Observations
- The visualization effectively highlights temperature extremes over the years.
- Record-breaking events in 2015 are clearly visible.
- The interactive map provides geographic context to the stations used.

## Future Improvements
- Use interactive visualization libraries like Plotly.
- Expand the dataset to include other climate variables.
- Automate data updates with real-time NOAA data.
